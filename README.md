Name: JavaClient
Description: Client for a server made in Java, for fun and learning about socket connections/handling.

This code when compiled and ran opens a client that can connect to a server on a specified port. This 
can be useful for many things such as connecting to a webpage (not reading the webpage, just connecting)
or connecting to a server hosted on a network. By changing the server address and port, the client will
connect to that server on that specified port.
